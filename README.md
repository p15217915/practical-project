I used different navigation bar styles to design the website in order to make it easier for the user to use
the website at different levels. With the mobile style, I chose to use a drop-down menu to view the navigation
as would be less space on the screen to access the different links, I then chose to enlarge the menu vertically
for the media screen as there is more space to fit the tabs on that type of screen, finally for the larger
screens I chose to make fix the bar to the top of the screen so that the user doesn't have to scroll up to the
top of the screen to navigate the site.

I chose to make the site a single page app, as I believe that is the best way to showcase all the information
easily and ensures that the user doesn't find themselves at a dead-end while traversing the site.

I used the Google maps API to find and mark the location of the team stadium on the site, so that the usr can
find the location directly on the website and not have to search elsewhere. by using the API instead of an image
the user can zoom in and out to help further pinpoint the location.

I also re visited the lab session code to help me to write the code for the website.
