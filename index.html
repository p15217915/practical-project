		<h3 id = "james-harden"> James Harden </h3>
		<img src="resources/JHarden.png" alt="Harden" />
		<p>
		Ever since James Harden made his move from the OKC Thunder to the Rockets
		he has become the outright star that they needed to take them to the next level.
		His dynamic playstyle, accurate shooting, creative passing and his signtature handles and 
		footwork make him a nightmare for defenders and are just some of the reasons that he is a 
		perennial MVP candidate and makes the Rockets a dangerous playoff threat. His stat line
		makes for interesting reading as he is a high volume scorer, capable of dropping 50 points 
		at any time, but is also an accomplished playmaker, even leading the NBA in assissts during the
		2016/17 Season. His awkward but effective driving style leads him to a high success rate when 
		going to the basket and also help him to efficiently draw fouls and shoot a high number of free 
		throws. Harden is the heart and soul of this Rockets team, and if they are to win the NBA
		championship in the near future he will have to show up at the highest level during the playoffs.
		</p>
		<h3 id = "chris-paul">Chris Paul</h3>
		<img src="resources/CPaul.png" alt="Paul" />
		<p>
		If Harden is the heart and soul of the Rockets franchise, then Chris Paul is its on court brain.
		Despite being a shorter player than most even at the point guard position, Paul has stamped his 
		mark in the NBA as the leagues premier point guard. While not necessarily the best overall
		player in his position, Paul is the player who most epitomises the definiition of the position.
		He is an accomplished pickpocket having led the league in steals on multiple occasions and is
		an even better playmaker with elite court vision, masterful handles and the near perfection
		of the passing fundamentals as well as the flashy aspects. Paul is one of a select few players
		to average above 10 assists per game in a season and is almost averaging that mark for his entire
		career. He is no slouch on the offensive end of play either with an accurate stroke from either the
		mid or three point range. The addition of Paul to this Rockets team makes this amongst the biggest
		threats to the Warriors for the NBA title and could make this Rockets team the most dangerous they 
		have been since the glory days of Hakeem 'The Dream' Olajuwon.
